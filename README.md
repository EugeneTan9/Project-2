# Project-2

This project is a to-do list. It allows users to plan their day to day events in this website. User can insert, update or delete an entry as of day to day entry to remind them of their tasks.

I have used sha256, express and react for this. Its still a work in progress as I'm trying to create a team project function so that other people will be able to see another user's entries that are under the same project title.
